   <h1>TECHNOLOGY FORENSICS</h1>  
   <!-- Anytime you have text you put it in a paragraph  -->
 <p>A technology forensics specialist is an information technology professional who supports the military, corporate, law 
    enforcement and legal communities in the investigation and analysis of digital data. Students in the Technology Forensics 
    degree will learn methods to obtain and document digital information, determine how information was compromised, trace 
    attribution of malicious code and reverse engineer data to develop mitigations and countermeasures. This degree will prepare 
    students to anticipate new and emerging technologies so they can be successful within the rapidly evolving digital forensics 
    environment and the increasingly complete threat landscape. Graduates from the Technology Forensics major will have both 
    the technical skills for recovering evidence and the presentation skills to provide both detailed technical and summary data to 
    interested parties. Above all, this degree will focus on learning the highly technical and cutting-edge technologies affecting IT 
    systems today and tomorrow. The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code for Technology Forensics is 11.1003. </p>
